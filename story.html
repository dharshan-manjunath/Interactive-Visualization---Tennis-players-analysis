                Firstly, Data Cleaning is performed on the dataset. Missing values in the data is handled by deleting the entire row in the dataset. Then data analysis is performed from the year 2004 to 2014 on the selected 6 players. In Tennis game, there exists a psychological advantage to win first and second point in a set. If the player wins points on the first and second serve on a row. This indirectly sends a dominance and player form message and create extra stress on the opponent. This stress on the opponent can in turn can effect the his overall performace during the match. Based on my analysis, a decrease trend is observed on the opponent return percentage when the player has higher chances of winning the first and second point during match. The Scatter-Bubble Plot demonstrates this Decreased pattern of Opponent Return Winning chances with an increase in player's winning first two points in the match. We can also observe the Players total points scored is also decreased with an increase in player winning first and second point during the game. There are three interesting observations based on the analysis done. 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Rafael Nadal consistently maintained lower error points against his opponent in every match. Though Opponent have more Ace points than Rafael Nadal, Rafael Nadal managed to win the match with his overall performance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Roger Federer has scored more Ace points than his opponents in most of the matches he won.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In every match, Andy Murray has higher first point winning percentage in comparision with his opponents.
                    </li>
                    
                </ul>
                Hovering over each scatter bubble the Radar chart gives quick comparision between player and his opponent performance during each match. The bright Cyan color shows the player statistics and bright Coral pink shows the opponent statistics during the match. The Player stats are scaled accordingly for each of the different axes to view the difference between player and opponent statistics clearly. Set of vibrant colors are used in both scatter bubble plot and Radar chart so that distinction is clearly visible. The key aspects used to visualise the player's strengths and weaknesses are given in the table below.
